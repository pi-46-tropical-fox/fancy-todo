# Todoers! App

Your one-stop solution for todo-lists.

## Features

Note: This will be updated accordingly.

* RESTful API
* (WIP) Mobile-friendly UI design, based on Tailwind CSS
* Pastee API
* Daily wallpapers by Bing API
* Programming quotes API

## Usage

Head over to `server` folder, and run `npm i`. Then, rename `.env.template` to `.env`, and set the desired `SECRET` key inside there.

After that, run `npx nodemon app` to start the server. More information about how the API works, refer to the `README.md` inside the same folder.

Then, head over to `client` folder, and do the same steps as the `server` folder.

And finally, open `http://localhost:<port>` in the browser to start the app in action. By default, inside `.env.template`, the provided port is `3457`.
